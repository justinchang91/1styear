Linear program

Branching program

TAs will be looking for flow charts 

Boolean assignments : True or False 

two statements, put and in between if the first is false, the comuter wont evalauate the second one

if statements used to control which instructions are executed by creating a branch in the code
if what is under the if statement is true, that is evaluated

use elif so the program doesn't have to go through all the ifs
