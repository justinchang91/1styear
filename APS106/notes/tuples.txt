TUPLES

-used to group a number of items into a single compound value
-tuple is an ordered, comma-separated sequence of values

-written using parentheses (): (2,3), ('a', 'bc')

Creating tuples:

julia = ('Julia Roberts', 1967, 'Actress', 'Atlanta')
car_info = (45, 'Toyota', 'Prius')

b = tuple([2,3])
b 
-> (2,3)
type(b) = tuple

a = tuple("cd")
a
-> ('c','d')

A tuple with a single element is (x,) NOT (x)

(x, y) = (4.2, 0.1)
x
-> 4.2
y
-> 0.1

NOTE: number of variables on left MUST = number of variables on right

Packing tuples
bob = tuple(["Bob", 19, "MIE"])
bob
-> ('Bob', 19, 'MIE')

Unpacking tuples
bob = tuple(["Bob", 19, "MIE"])
(name, age, department) = bob
name -> 'bob'
age -> 19
department -> 'MIE'

PROPERTIES:

-Tuples can be subscripted, sliced and looped over
car_info[1] -> 'Toyota'

-They are IMMUTABLE. Can not be changed once created.
life[0] = life[1] -> ERROR

HOWEVER. The objects INSIDE can be mutated.
life[0][1] = 80

Advantages:
-makes code safer by "write-protecting" data
-makes functions more flexible so you can return multiple values at once. (Have to return it into a tuple of 
the same size as the return values though)
