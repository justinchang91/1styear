Types of errors:

Logical errors (poor understanding of problem): 
-unintended result due to miscalculation/miunderstanding of specifications
-code will not crash

Syntax errors (spelling and grammar):
-programming language cannot understand your code
ex. missing parenthesis or backet, missing an operator, illegal variable name

Runtime errors
-occurs during the execution (runtime) of a program
ex. infinte loops, trying to access index out of bounds

Semantic errors 
-improper use of statements or variables
ex. using an operator not intended for the variable type, calling function 
with wrong argument type / wrong number of arguments


Functions:

What is a function?
-block of organized (reusable) code used to perform an activity
-python has built in functions but you can also make your own "user-defined"
functions

Why functions?
-reusability of code
-technique for managing code
-good for group work

Calling functions: function_name(argument)
-evaluate the arguments (values passed to the function)
-call the function passing in the arguments (you put the arguments in)
