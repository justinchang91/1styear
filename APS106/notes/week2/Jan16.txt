Defining functions:

def function_name(parameters) : 
	docstring
	body (indented)
	return something (could be none! ex. printThis(), just prints stuff, doesn't return stuff to main)

parameter = variable whose value will be supplied when function is called

Argument: a value given to a function
Pass: to provide to a function
Call: ask python to execute a function
Return: pass back a value 

Six main steps for designing a function:
1. examples (what does function do?)
2. type contract (input/output parameter types. Function expects string but you give it an int)
3. header (choose good name)
4. description (write a DOCSTRING to describe the function. docstring written in """ or ''')
5. body (write the code)
6. test (verify the function on examples)
