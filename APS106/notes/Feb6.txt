General form of list:

[expr1, expr2, ... , exprN]

enclosed in [] and separated by (,)

list can be assigned to a variable

variable = [expr1, expr2, ... , exprN]


-list elements may be of any type
-list can also contain elements of more than one type

street_address = [10, 'Main street']

lists can be indexed like strings

grades = [80, 60, 50]
grades[1] -> 60

grades can also be sliced grades[0:2], grades[::-2]

LISTS ARE MUTABLE
-the contents can be mutated (modified)

Aliasing 
-Aliases: when two variables refer to the same objects
-When we modify one variable, we are modifying the object it refers to hence 
 we are also modifying the second variable
-if you have two names for an object, if you change the aspect of of one of the names, you also change it 
 for the other.

.append() to add an object to end of list
.extend() to add list to the end of list 
.remove() to remove items
.reverse() reverses the list
.sort() sorts from smallest to largest
.insert(int, object) inserts object at the given index, moving items to make roo 


nested lists - lists can contain lists!
[list1, list2, list3]

grades = [['Assignment 1', 80], ['Assignment 2', 90], ['Assignment 3], 70]]
grades[0] -> ['Assignment 1, 80']
grades[0][1] -> 80
