# 1styear

This is just a project that shows everything that I have done in my first year at UofT Engineering. This was for the first year coding 
course where we learned Python as our starting language. The project I am the most proud of was the maze solver project where we had to
create a back tracking algorithm using recursion to solve as maze that was given as a csv file.
